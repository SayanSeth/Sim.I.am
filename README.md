simiam
======

A MATLAB-based Educational Bridge Between Theory and Practice in Robotics.

**NOTE**: This version of Sim.I.am requires the installation of [GUI Layout Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox) for MATLAB 2014b. Consequently, this HG2 version of Sim.I.am is no longer backwards compatible with previous releases, such as those for the Coursera course, Control of Mobile Robots.
