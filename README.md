Sim.I.am
======

Sim.I.am is mobile robot simulator for MATLAB and Simulink that facilitates the implementation and design of controllers and algorithms that can be deployed on both simulated and actual mobile robots. It is brought to you by the [Georgia Robotics and InTelligent Systems Laboratory](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home).

**NOTE**: This version of Sim.I.am requires the installation of [GUI Layout Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox) for MATLAB 2014b and Later. Consequently, this Updated version of Sim.I.am is no longer backwards compatible with previous releases, such as those for the Coursera course, Control of Mobile Robots.
